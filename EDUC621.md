# Professional Growth and Development

I have learned a lot through this course and the information provided by it. This course provided me with a list of Evidence Based Practices that have already been researched and documented, as well at different trainings that can be used with a wide variety of 
students. The BOOK, used for this class allowed me to read about many techniques used with children with challenging behaviors and why it is so important to document, retry, and stay positive. Documentation provides the educator with the ability to look back over and decide on if the behaviors occur at a similar time when they are noticed. It also allows the teacher to determine how best to take the next step in helping the child. If that means looking into their culture, their background, their home routine, and their transition ability they may find an answer through observation. Retrying some of the interventions or steps to lessen an unwanted behavior can be beneficial because with some cases it could change over time. Staying positive is also important because children learn behaviors that they are most exposed to. When trying to work with a child positive talk and positive reinforcement are key to create an environment and relationship that allows both the teacher and the student to thrive. 

Learning about cultural differences and the way that it affects how a student functions in school was also very interesting to me. Working at a daycare we do not often think about home life and the types of situations that cause the behaviors at school. However, after that week in class I thought about it while at work. To me we do not have cultural differences in our center, I am located in a mainly white community. The difference I noticed however was the way parents and children interacted upon drop off or pick up times. It occurred to me that even though we may not have a different culture by ethnicity or background, the way we interact with the child is different. Many parents do not have as much structure as a daycare or a school does. If the structure systems are different and what is considered negative behavior is different, the behaviors may also be treated different in the two settings. 

# Impact on PK-12 Student Learner

Contemplating that children’s expectations at home and at daycare are different, I changed my perspective a little with my class. I spent a week observing parents with their child during the time that I am able to see them together. It wasn’t extremely hard to see which parents had set expectations and rules at home, but those who didn’t were like chameleons. They fell in line with the other parents about behaviors and interactions depending on who was dropping their child off or picking them up at the same time. Some parents took charge of the situation and directed the child on what to do an how quickly to do it. For example, a parent walks in during free choice and tells the child to clean up (child listens) and get your things. This family was easily spotted as one with structure at home. The child usually listens to directions at school and is sometimes rebellious when they feel like seeing what they can get away with. After completing about 3 days worth of observations on these interactions I was able to figure out ways to work with children who lacked structure at home. They were given positive reinforcement when target behaviors were observed. A lot of the time this was in the form of an acknowledging comment, but others it was a chance to choose from the prize bin in the room. It was interesting to see how the behaviors in the classroom changed if just a child or two was praised for a specific behavior. Soon half the class was trying to mimic such behaviors and hoping for the same outcome.
