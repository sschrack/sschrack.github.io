# Professional Growth and Development

I have learned a lot through this course and the information provided by it. This course provided me with a list of Evidence Based Practices that have already been researched and documented, as well at different trainings that can be used with a wide variety of 
students. The textbook (Zirpoli, T. (2012). Behavior Management: Positive Applications for Teachers. Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson.) used for this class allowed me to read about many techniques used with children with challenging behaviors and why it is so important to document, retry, and stay positive. Documentation provides the educator with the ability to look back over and decide on if the behaviors occur at a similar time when they are noticed. It also allows the teacher to determine how best to take the next step in helping the child. If that means looking into their culture, their background, their home routine, and their transition ability they may find an answer through observation. Retrying some of the interventions or steps to lessen an unwanted behavior can be beneficial because with some cases it could change over time. Staying positive is also important because children learn behaviors that they are most exposed to. When trying to work with a child positive talk and positive reinforcement are key to create an environment and relationship that allows both the teacher and the student to thrive. 

Learning about cultural differences and the way that it affects how a student functions in school was also very interesting to me. Working at a daycare we do not often think about home life and the types of situations that cause the behaviors at school. However, after that week in class I thought about it while at work. To me we do not have cultural differences in our center, I am located in a mainly white community. The difference I noticed however was the way parents and children interacted upon drop off or pick up times. It occurred to me that even though we may not have a different culture by ethnicity or background, the way we interact with the child is different. Many parents do not have as much structure as a daycare or a school does. If the structure systems are different and what is considered negative behavior is different, the behaviors may also be treated different in the two settings. 

# Impact on PK-12 Student Learner

Contemplating that children’s expectations at home and at daycare are different, I changed my perspective a little with my class. I spent a week observing parents with their child during the time that I am able to see them together. It wasn’t extremely hard to see which parents had set expectations and rules at home, but those who didn’t were like chameleons. They fell in line with the other parents about behaviors and interactions depending on who was dropping their child off or picking them up at the same time. Some parents took charge of the situation and directed the child on what to do an how quickly to do it. For example, a parent walks in during free choice and tells the child to clean up (child listens) and get your things. This family was easily spotted as one with structure at home. The child usually listens to directions at school and is sometimes rebellious when they feel like seeing what they can get away with. After completing about 3 days worth of observations on these interactions I was able to figure out ways to work with children who lacked structure at home. They were given positive reinforcement when target behaviors were observed. A lot of the time this was in the form of an acknowledging comment, but others it was a chance to choose from the prize bin in the room. It was interesting to see how the behaviors in the classroom changed if just a child or two was praised for a specific behavior. Soon half the class was trying to mimic such behaviors and hoping for the same outcome. 

# Application of CEC Standards

**Development and Characteristics of Learners:**

Outcome # 3 directly states that through this course students show proficiency in “utilizing knowledge of human motivation and behavior drawn from the foundational sciences of psychology, anthropology and sociology to develop strategies for organizing and supporting individual and group work for CD, SLD, and EBD students in a cross-categorical or inclusive setting.” This to me was best shown through the readings, research, and links provided that gave information on PBIS (Positive Behavior Intervention Supports) and positive reinforcement. These are the two biggest topics that allowed me to dig deeper into how to positively motivate students. It showed me that there are many different types of motivation and that in order to positively motivate someone, you must find their main motivator. For younger children food and water are often the biggest motivator. As they get older, stickers and prizes can be a big motivator. Research has shown us that PBIS works in a school wide setting to reduce challenging behaviors when used in a meaningful way. If there is not meaning in it for the students the results will be different than what is expected. Each student learns and processes in a different way and I think it is our job as educators to help them find the best way to turn challenging behaviors into exceptional behaviors worth praising and showing off. 

**Individual Learning Differences:**

Outcome # 2 for this course directly states that students who take this course “know how to use instructional strategies that promote student learning for a wide range of CD, SLD, and EBD student abilities.” This outcome can best be shown through the research on evidence based practices. We were told to choose three to briefly discuss and of those three choose one to go into further detail. I think that this shows different instructional strategies because the EBP’s allowed me to learn about Social Skills Training, Picture Exchange Communication (PECS), Self-Management (SM), and Task Analysis (TA). Of these different strategies I decided to learn more about social skills training. It was different to think that the students who were not on the autism spectrum were the ones learning the skill first and helping the other child to generalize the skill. They met with the teacher in charge to learn how best to train the student with autism on the new skill they were expected to show. 

**Collaboration:**

Outcome # 4 directly states that students in this course “engages CD, SLD, and EBD students in individual and cooperative learning activities that help them develop motivation to achieve by relating lessons to personal interests, allowing choices of learning, leading students to ask questions and pursue problems that are meaningful to them.” I am not currently in a situation where I was able to implement and serve students who fall under these categories. However, I work with younger children who can use the same tools learned in this class to challenge then and help them become self-motivators in a classroom. The biggest part of all of this was talking with coworkers and those in areas that involved working with children who have challenging behaviors. I had the pleasure to discuss challenging behaviors with Sheila Warren from the Hudson School District and learn about interventions used with her Emotional Behavioral Disability students. After looking over some strategies that she used on a regular basis and reading about the different motivators that children had, I talked with my students to see what interested them. This was a lot of fun answers with Halloween right around the corner. It led my students to ask questions about the types of books we were reading and decide which types of projects they wanted to work on. I spent a week revolving what we learned about based on their interests. This helped them to solve their own problems and choose what they wanted to engage in within the classroom.
