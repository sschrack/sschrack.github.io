Hello, my name is Samantha Schrack. I am a student at Viterbo University completing the Cross-Categorical Special Education Program. I started Fall of 2017.  I completed my undergraduate degree at the University of Wisconsin- River Falls for Elementary Education and Early Childhood. Currently I work at a daycare center in Chippewa Falls, WI. Starting out at the center in February of 2016 I was placed in the toddler classroom. For the last four months or so however, I was working in the four year old room with a little boy who is Autistic. Now with staffing changes, enrollment changes, and a general need for changes at the center I am gladly working in the one year old room. 

Prior to graduating UW-RF, I was a dance teacher and a personal care assistant. These were jobs that I loved dearly and had been doing throughout my undergraduate program. They were fun and gave me a chance to work with a wide variety of children.
