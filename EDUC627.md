# Intellectual Disabilities

## Artifact 

[Intellectual Disabilities Presentation](sschrack.github.io/Intellectual Disability.pptx)

**Intellectual Disabilities Presentation**

This presentation is an accumulation of the research and work I have done since starting this graduate program. The courses I have taken have all taught different techniques and strategies to use in all sorts of settings. I chose to use this presentation as my artifact because this is the focus area I have chosen for my cross-categorical degree. This presentation has basic information about this disability category that can be used to inform general education teachers about intellectual disabilities. I would use this presentation to help my colleagues understand the disability a little better and to create appropriate alterations to their lesson plans. 

## Professional Growth and Development

This course has helped me develop a greater understanding of IEP's and the process of writing them. My understanding of appropriate goals and writing them has grown. I learned that although it is helpful to be specific in a goal, there is no need to provide too much information. Short, sweet, and to the point is most beneficial to those who read it. 

This course has helped me to grow in my communication skills as well. Prior to starting this graduate program I have had a hard time writing responses to others discussion posts. Although I am still not where I would like to be, I feel that I get closer everytime I respond to a post. I know that a response should be thought out and that it is important to respond to the material posted about. 

## Student Learning

The greatest thing I learned from this course was about intellectual disabilities. I went into the class thinking I knew a lot about this category, but I was extremely wrong. I had no idea that there were different severity levels other than mild and profound. It was interesting to learn about mild, moderate, severe, and profound intellectual disabilities and their descriptors or qualifiers.
