**Intellectual Disabilities Presentation**

This presentation is an accumulation of the research and work I have done since starting this graduate program. The courses I have taken have all taught different techniques and strategies to use in all sorts of settings. I chose to use this presentation as my artifact because this is the focus area I have chosen for my cross-categorical degree. This presentation has basic information about this disability category that can be used to inform general education teachers about intellectual disabilities. I would use this presentation to help my colleagues understand the disability a little better and to create appropriate alterations to their lesson plans. 

## Professional Growth and Development

This course has helped me develop a greater understanding of IEP's and the process of writing them. My understanding of appropriate goals and writing them has grown. I learned that although it is helpful to be specific in a goal, there is no need to provide too much information. Short, sweet, and to the point is most beneficial to those who read it. 

This course has helped me to grow in my communication skills as well. Prior to starting this graduate program I have had a hard time writing responses to others discussion posts. Although I am still not where I would like to be, I feel that I get closer everytime I respond to a post. I know that a response should be thought out and that it is important to respond to the material posted about. 

## Student Learning

The most important thing I learned from this course was about intellectual disabilities. I went into the class thinking I knew a lot about this category, but I was extremely wrong. I had no idea that there were different severity levels other than mild and profound. It was interesting to learn about mild, moderate, severe, and profound intellectual disabilities and their descriptors or qualifiers. Intellectual disabilities is a very interesting category. Reading about mild intellectual disabilities explained what I thought of when intellectual disabilities is brought up. The other end of that spectrum is the profound level, which is often what people think of when you mention intellectual disabilities. The differing descriptions was interesting to learn about. I had no idea there were moderate and severe levels of intellectual disabilities instead of just mild and profound. However, these four levels explained a lot. There are differing IQ levels and this disability has to be tested with an IQ test. The characteristics of each level is different. 

## Application of CEC Standards

[CEC Standards](CECStandards.html)

**Instructional Planning and Strategies**

Outcome six clearly states that a professional completing this course will be able to understand how to make instructional decisions to meet the physical, social, emotional, moral, and cognitive development of students identified as ED, LD, or CD/ID. I feel that this outcome is met through this course and meets this standard due to our work with lesson planning and case studies provided by each individual in the course. Making instructional decisions was displayed in the case studies the best because it showed how students differ in each classroom setting. This also allowed peers to collaborate and work together on strategies they have seen work in their own experience. Through these discussions, peers were able to find new strategies or ideas they have forgotten about in order to help their students. 

**Curricular Content Knowledge**

Outcome three states that professionals can identify and design instruction that is appropriate to students' stages of development, learning styles, strengths and needs. This standard is met through this outcome because it is used to write a lesson that identifies the various needs of children in the classroom. The assignment that this is shown the most with was the lesson plan assignment. I used an outside resource that could be used for an extended school year lesson. This assignment allowed me to view age appropriate lessons and activities. I was given the opportunity to consider how I would alter "normal" teaching methods to meet the needs of students on IEP's and those who struggle. I believe that this meets the curricular content knowledge standard because I based the grade level lesson as a review of knowledge they would have gained in the appropriate grade for the activity chosen.  

**Learner Development and Individual Learning Differences**

Outcome two states that professionals can define criteria for emotional, learning or cognitive disabilities and explain it in simplified language to parents, students, and teachers. This course meets the learner development and learning differences standard without it being linked to any particular outcome due to the nature of this course. We could not research and learn about our specified focus area without meeting this standard. For me it was intellectual disabilities and I would have to know how students who fall under this category develop and the characteristics shown for this category. With that being said, I believe that the outcome I chose best fits with this standard because of the end portion of it. As professionals, there is a lot of jargon involved in our work but we must always be conscious of our language when explaining to parents, students, and other teachers. They are not always aware of the meaning of words used specifically in the special education field and it may add to the frustration of the entire process. We want to work as a team and that means that everyone needs to understand what is going on with the student being focused on. In order for these concepts to continue to work and for the child's needs to be met appropriately, everyone involved must understand the learning differences of the student.
