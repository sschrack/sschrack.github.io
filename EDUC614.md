This Individual Education Program write-up based off of the case study of student Kate is an important addition to my online portfolio because it is a big part of the job. As a future Cross-Categorical Special Education teacher, an IEP is part of each student’s school year. It is necessary to understand what each section of an IEP needs to help it be implemented properly. This class has taught me that I can do this task that I was extremely nervous about completing. I know it is not perfect, but I was able to practice something that will be an annual task as a teacher.
After writing this IEP I have learned a lot about myself and my goals as a teacher. This is the one task that I have struggled with and worried about since starting the program. I am a bit of a perfectionist and filling out the IEP was stressful. I learned that it is not as hard as I initially thought, but I still have a long way to go if I want to write a “perfect” IEP. This is setting a high standard for myself and I know that I may never reach it, but if I can not set high goals for myself how am I going to set high standards for my students? Obviously, I know that I can not set unreachable standards, but hopefully I can continue to learn how to write reachable goals. 
Through this course I have learned how to begin writing an individual education program. I learned that this important piece of my future job is not always easy, but something we have to strive for as teachers. To me this artifact shows that I have done my best to complete an IEP and that I now have a baseline for myself. 


## Professional Growth and Development

This course has taught me a lot about the field I hope to one day be working in. There is a lot more to the job than just trying to help the students meet their academic goals and keep on task with their peers. It is important to remember that we as professionals must think of the whole child in this field. We must remember that their social/emotional needs have to be met in order for them to succeed in any situation we place them in. 

Through this course I was reminded that it is important to research and learn new ways to explain or practice things. I learned about the term neurodiversity. This term changed the way I view ADHD and other disabilities. An article I read sparked a memory about the brain from when I was in high school. In my Spanish class the teacher described to us how we must continue to use the knowledge we are gaining in her course or we will lose it. It is like building a road through a quickly growing environment, if we do not continue to push forwards the road connection would be lost forever. This made sense to me at the time, but looking back I do not like this metaphor because it does not relate to how I personally view the brain. The way neurodiversity was explained made much more sense because it was described as a rainforest. The brain has diversity in it, all the information trying to survive in one ecosystem. There is dominance and growth, or decay. The brain can either retain and thrive with information, or if it goes unutilized the skill or information will fade away. I think this research and thought process is where I grew the most during this class. It made me look up more information about the brain and the way we store information. 

## Student Learning

Learning new information and continuing to search for research based practices is an important part of the academic field. We cannot just sit around and assume that the learning we recieved while gaining a degree/licensure is always the most accurate. That however was not the the biggest take away from this course. My favorite thing to have learned while taking this course is how to write a measurable goal. I may not be completely there yet, but I know I am well on my way. A measurable goal needs to be SMART; specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, and timely. Goals should be specific because then anyone is able to follow it and understand what they are working towards. A measurable goal includes a baseline, criteria, and what the goal is working towards. For example, a baseline of 25% to work up to 60%. The important thing to remember is that a goal must be attainable. If you are setting a goal based on percentages then finding something to work on that is attainable is necessary when considering the goal. For example, a student who reads 120 words per minute to 175 words per minute is attainable when looking at the timeline. A timely goal is also important because if there is no end time, how will you know if you met it in time. There is a difference between increasing a words per minute goal with no end time and saying that this goal will be met by the end of the year. 

## CEC Standards

[CEC STANDARDS](standards.md)

**Assessment**

According to outcome number two in the syllabus, professionals will develop communication, collaboration and intervention skills to accomplish their work is met through the assessment standard because it helps those who took the class write and Individual Education Program. Through the discussion forums and writing different items for creating an IEP, I feel that this outcome has been met through the assessment standard. Assessment is an important part of writing an IEP, but using communication and intervention skills is necessary for this standard to be met with accuracy. 

**Learner Development and Individual Learner Differences**

Outcome number three clearly states that education professionals will develop professional dispositions of inquiry, collaboration, problem-solving, advocacy and continuous improvement. In my opinion this outcome is met through the learner development and individual learner differences standard because students are not the only ones who learn and develop differently. As a future teacher I hope that I can create an environment to help other education professionals improve upon their knowledge of differing skills and student talents. If we cannot strive to learn new things each day, then my job is not worth doing because I am a strong believer in the ability to learn something new each day. 

**Collaboration**

Outcome number five states that professionals connect theory, practice, and research to inform educational decisions and foster inclusive learning environments that support diverse learners. Without collaboration finding different theories, practices, and research would not be possible. This class has shown me through the forums that it all depends on what you are looking for and your perspective when researching, that is why collaboration is so important in researching. Without the background knowledge attained through research, practice, and theory fostering inclusive learning environments would not be possible.
