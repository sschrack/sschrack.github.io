## Artifact 

[Summary of Evaluation]
[Sample EBD Report]
**Summary of Evaluation:**

The summary of evaluation was chosen as my artifact because I believe that it shows my ability to find the important information contained in an assessment. Student #4 needed help with his social skills, his coping skills, his communication skills, ways to include sensory into more activities, but his academics were appropriate for his grade level. This artifact also allows me to look at the foundations of this child’s challenging behavior. The assessments used (BASC-3, The Sensory Profile, Classroom Observations, Home Observations, and Parent Interview) showed he was unable to cope and self sooth in situations where he was frustrated. This is a skill that is normally learned in infancy if not by at least the age of 4 years old. His parents, teachers, and supportive staff all mentioned that at times he is unable to communicate (use expressive language) in a way to that allows him the supports he is needed. Through looking at the evaluations and their findings, I could see that sometimes language is the cause. When language is not the barrier, he may be more equipped to cope when provided with sensory input tools to allow him to calm down. 
	
## Professional Growth and Development

At the beginning of this course I knew there was a lot for me to learn, however I did not think that the many types of assessments would be the hardest part of the learning process. It was eye opening to see the sheer amount of options available for use while assessing a student. Anywhere from initial evaluations of grade level abilities to how to complete an Functional Behavioral Assessment, which I had never heard of before. Having the chance to use some of them and read more about them was intriguing, and it made me realize what I thought I knew about special education and what I knew, were two different things. I knew that evidence based practices were always best in any classroom, but using such evaluations as an FBA or Running Record could provide the teacher with plenty of reasons why a student is not functioning or processing the information necessary to succeed in a classroom setting. Working in childcare limited my ability to see these assessments used or talk to a professional face to face about them. However, it did mean that I got to reach out to another district that I had prior connections to. I got to hear which assessments they used (though I doubt it varies much) in the Hudson School District. 

This course gave me the resources to learn more about what an FBA is, how it is used, and when it should be used. Using the information provided through links, discussions, and an assignment, I was able to work with some coworkers at the childcare center and look at one child in particular. She was showing signs of needing help in the regulatory skills area and we just wanted to make sure that between the four of us, parents, and support staff at the daycare that we were focusing on the correct skill area that is lacking. We completed an FBA for her, and although she is not eligible for any sort of assistance we were able to narrow down when these regulatory skills become the biggest issue in her daily routine. Following looking through the evaluation and it’s results, a discussion begins. Our biggest questions were “what do I do now?”, “how do we fit this skill in?”, and “do we even have the staff to make this happen?” The answers varied based on who you talked to, what they were in charge of, and if our staffing arrangements were changing or not. The best answer we could come up with was to start a Behavior Intervention Plan that implemented regulatory skills training into our morning meetings and transitions. As staffing changes often happen at a center when child enrollment fluctuates and teacher positions are not always filled, I was moved to a room that needed me more. However, I do know that the room this child is in continues to implement as much as they can of the BIP into her daily routine. 

As a future special education teacher, I believe it is important to be able to describe evaluations and results to those outside of the field (i.e. parents/guardians). My summary of evaluation on Student #4 does not utilize much jargon or overgeneralize the findings of the evaluation. If I were a parent, I feel that this evaluation summary would be simple enough to read and understand even if the assessments discussed are not ones that you are familiar with. It is important to know when to use jargon and when to use plain language. By this I mean that as teachers we use different types of language on a daily basis with our students, colleagues, superiors, and parents.  Knowing the difference between how to talk to students and how to talk to superiors is one thing. Talking with someone who knows the in’s and out’s of evaluations should be completely different than how you describe the information found to a parent/guardian. 

The specific outcomes of this artifact were to show an ability to decipher what to focus on when evaluations of a child have been completed in order to best meet their needs at their level. This artifact, along with the sample evaluation that I got my information from gave many areas of possible deficit. Through further examination, it was easier to tell where the behaviors derived. The evaluation showed that he was eligible for Emotional Behavior Disability supports, but also that he seeks to add sensory input into every experience. To me, this showed that it was necessary for him to have such inputs while learning the skills he needs to cope with frustration.  

## Impact on PK-12 Student Learner

This course provided students in my class a chance to really look at the source of their behaviors. Learning about different assessments allowed me to dig deeper into the function of their behaviors and delays that I was previously concerned about. With the background knowledge necessary to understand the child, my co-teacher and I were able to assess the children better. 

For example, one of the students in my room was unable to keep her hands to herself and was constantly trying to be the “center of attention”. One day I decided I was going to observe her behaviors at a time that she struggled with them the most. I noticed something very interesting, she wasn’t trying to hurt anyone when she was grabbing them. She was hoping that this behavior would allow her a little extra attention. That week she was provided some extra attention from the teachers sporadically throughout the day, and nothing about this behavior changed. Going back to the observations and notes we had taken on her in the past, I noticed that she was constantly grabbing the same children and goofing off in front of those children as well. She wanted them to play and include her in what they were doing. She wasn’t after the teacher’s attention it was her group of “friends” that she needed the attention from. It mattered to her who this attention that she received was coming from. Discovering this allowed me to help her with some communication skills necessary in this type of situation. We talked about “may I play with you”, “can I join”, “I would like a turn”, and “please stop”. These are phrases used in every classroom at our center, and the best chance she had of making a meaningful connection to the skills. Although these skills have taken time to accumulate, the hope is that in the next month or so she will use these phrases or ones similar to try to interact with her friends. I believe that stewardship is seen through this example. I still check in with this child regularly to discuss and talk about what ways she can best get involved with the group of friends she wishes to. Often it takes a few prompts, but a lot of the time she has shown much progress in being closer to generalize these skills into her daily activities. 

## Application of CEC Standards

**Development and Characteristics of Learners:**

*Outcome #1* of this course directly states that a student should “recognize expected developmental progressions and ranges of individual variation within each domain (physical, social, emotional, moral, and cognitive) and can identify levels of readiness in learning; understands how development in any domain may affect performance in others.” One of the first assignments of this course was to complete an handout for parents/guardians on developmental milestones. This handout needed to have what was appropriate at three different age levels and included physical, social/emotional, and academic domains. I researched the ages of 4, 5, and 8 years old because these are ages where the biggest jumps in development occur in the elementary school system. At four years old a child should be able to communicate in full sentences, run with a normal stride, and recognize their name or the beginning letters of their name. At five years old a child should recognize the majority of the letters in the alphabet, communicate feelings and frustrations, and hold a pencil in the correct manner. By eight years of age a child should be able to communicate and discuss their feelings and why they feel this way, become more active, and they are showing progress in their reading. This assignment required a lot of contemplation because there are so many milestones for children under the age of 10. I wanted to make sure that this assignment was in the field I hoped to one day be in. For me that was a big step towards thinking of where I want to be outside of the daycare world. I decided that I would like to work with ages 4-8 and the milestone groupings I was able to find in this range was for 4, 5, and 6-8. That solved my problem of where to start with this assignment. The other factor that I had to think about adding was when a parent/guardian should be talking with a doctor about concerns. In order for this handout to be of service to me and for me to serve those in my care I wanted it to have a when to be concerned portion. Young parents or parents who it is their first child going through schools and developing at a different rate than they were expecting I thought it was important to have a place for them to look if they were concerned. As a future educator in the special education it is important to have the information needed to best serve the parents of my students. 

**Communication:**

*Outcome #4* directly states that a student who has taken this course “knows about the process of second language acquisition and the strategies to support the learning on the students whose first language is not English.” Another assignment that I had to make for this course was an English Language Learners handout for other teaching professionals. This meant research about the process of language acquisition of a second language learner and the best way to connect it to how a native English speaker learns to speak the language. To my surprise it was similar to how an infant learns. First, a child does not have the skills to communicate in the language. Next, they begin to repeat short phrases or use the same phrase in different situations. Then, they will show comfortable use of these phrases in a variety of settings. As a student becomes more fluent in the language it is more common to see them use their language skills outside of the ELL classroom. Similar to an infant, whose language skills grow as they figure out how to use their vocal skills more accurately. In order for the integrity of information and quality of my assignment I spent a lot of time researching and researching everything I could. I wanted a key point to be about the development of the language and how it correlates to other children’s language acquisition. The biggest part to remember is that development of language happens at different stages and at the child’s own pace. Nothing can be forced and fluency in the English language can take 5-7 years to master. 
	
**Assessment:**

*Outcome #2* of this course directly states that students who complete this course are capable of “appropriately using and interpreting results of a variety of formal and informal assessment techniques.” This outcome can clearly be met through the completion of an FBA, evaluation summary, and scavenger hunt. Completion of a Functional Behavior Assessment shows the ability to look at the child as a whole. This assessment allows the educator to look at the students home life in comparison to their school life. The parent interview if done appropriately should give a good idea of how the child behaves at home. Using the Antecedent Behavior Consequence chart allows the educator to note behaviors and the antecedents to the behavior. It is also a good way to decide which reinforcers work and which do not. The summary of evaluation of a student shows that I can look at the results of evaluations and provide a good idea of best practices in how to proceed with the child. The scavenger hunt involved using the core value of hospitality. I needed to ask schools I had worked with in the past for their help in gathering information on assessments used in the CD, Autism, and EBD fields. I wanted to make sure that it was okay for me to talk to these professionals prior to reaching out to them, so I asked the principal who would be best to ask my questions to and then if the professional themselves had time to answer my questions. Luckily for me I was received with open arms and an abundance of answers on what types of assessments were used in each field.
