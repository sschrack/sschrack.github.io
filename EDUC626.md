## Artifact

[Progression of Inclusion Timeline](Progression of Inclusion Timeline Activity.pptx) 

I chose to use my Progression of Inclusion Timeline powerpoint because it shows two important types of inclusive change in history. First, this artifact shows the different types of schools that opened throughout history to provide children with disabilities an education. For example, Connecticut Asylum for the Education and Instruction of Deaf and Dumb Person's that opened in 1817, or the Horace Mann School for the Deaf that opened in 1869. Schools such as these helped children with some physical or learning disabilities went from being considered unteachable to being allowed to receive a form of education. However, it rarely met the same standards as a general education would. Second, this artifact shows a history of some major laws and mandates passed that would and still do affect the standards of learning for all children. This artifact best represents the outcomes of this class because of the progress shown over time of inclusive schools. School systems, as well as society, are not fully there yet. There may be a long way to go, but schools take steps towards the goal of inclusion each year. The timeline best shows the research put into this course. 

## Professional Growth and Development

Inclusive schools and classrooms vary based on a district's abilities to accomodate the students in their case load. Taking a look at even younger children, such as at a daycare level, and the funding and availabilities of professionals to guide these students is based on the staffs ability to advocate for such young children. Working in a daycare setting for just over two years has really opened my eyes to how different inclusion looks in different age levels. Back when I was student teaching and working with children of various ages in a dance studio, we had inclusive classes and non-inclusive classes. The difference between the two was the pace at which things were taught. Observing around my current job at a daycare center in Chippewa Falls, I can see that inclusion is based on the teachers in each room. Our center does not have much diversity or many children with exceptionalities. However, the few we do have are given only one option. If you go to our center, you are placed in one of two classrooms for your age range. This method of splitting up the children provides us with an automatic inclusive setting. This does not mean we are as inclusive as I once would have thought to consider us. 

Inclusion is allowing all children to be placed into one classroom and pulling them out if they need the extra help or a break when over stimulated. This class has shown me that this idea is not the least restrictive environment and is not actually considered inclusion if this is the response everytime something is a miss. Taking the child out of the classroom to participate in a seperate or even the same activity segregates the students and does not help them learn acceptance or socialization skills. In some classrooms at the center teachers will refuse to deal with difficult or frustrating situations and automatically call for assistance from our behavioral coach. Although she is there for our benefit, having her take a child who is seeking attention out of the classroom not only reinforces the negative behavior but does not teach the other students how to help that child. 

I have learned that inclusion affects all student learning, and that in a sense it is the top universal design for learning method. Inclusion teaches students many things, but what I find most important is the acceptance of all. This idea that everyone is equal and can be placed in the same room to learn sets our standards for all children high and helps them learn in new ways. Acceptance and understanding can help a student learn how to be a co-teacher or support for any other student with or without exceptionalities. Some key social skills learned through inclusive schools are; acceptance, empathy, peer and self-advocacy, co-teaching skills, and positive socialization. Students can also learn to be peacemakers to insure that the school has ways of stopping negative behavior prior to it breaking out into a fight. 

The best example I found in the text to show hope for how inclusion can be accomplished in a classroom was the Vision of Inclusion about Bob (Creating an Inclusive School, p.156). His story sticks out and gives me hope for the future of education continuing to be inclusive because it shows that the students can be the ones to initiate the change. In this story, Bob's soon-to-be classmates helped the administrative team provide him with what is socially appropriate and popular at the time of his transition to their school. This is important because it represents how accepting the next generation can be. We should follow their lead in including all students and allow them to help each other be a part of a community they are a part of. 

## Student Learning

As previously stated, I do work in a daycare center and inclusion is not commonly seen there. Often, we do not have much diversity at all in my current workplace as well. However, this class will help all of my future students as it has helped me to understand a lot about inclusion. Because of this class, I hope to better teach empathy and acceptance of all students. This is important to me because even students without disabilities are not always made to feel included in a school community. The goal of teaching such social skills to my future students would be to utilize peer learning in co-teaching to allow students to see first hand the differences everyone has in learning styles and processing styles. 

At my current workplace I plan to teach my students about acceptance, patience, and empathy through the pyramid model method utilized at my center. Pyramid model is the younger sibling to Positive Behavioral Intervention and Supports and can be used in early childhood programs. The center is working towards incorporating the ideals and procedures the best we can for the age levels worked with. The reason I would like to focus on acceptance, patience, and empathy with my children is because they are one-year-olds and these social skills are important in setting the ground work for understanding inclusion. Acceptance gives the students a chance to learn the importance of accepting everyone into our classroom. I am working on using gentle touches, greeting others when walking into a room, and providing toys that are accessible to all children in the center. The importance of patience being taught is because if you can learn patience at a young age, hopefully it will stick with you in the future. Patience is important when working on your own homework or when helping others to problem solve on their own. It can be frustrating to wait, but it is also an important skill. My class learns this skill best through practice. It is often seen best when waiting for their turn with a toy, following directions even when it is not the immediate outcome desired (cot vs. snack), and cleaning the room. These tasks do not always seem like they are teaching the children patience, but I cannot teach it if I do not practice it myself. Empathy is the hardest for one-year-olds to understand, but I think we have found a model that works in our room. The students have been giving hugs lately when they see a friend crying or upset. Usually we teach this through modeling and practice, "if you push a friend over you need to help them up and apologize". I am a strong believer in a child will show they are sorry in their own way and when they are ready. My classroom tends to show it through a hug or helping the upset child find a toy. 

## Application of CEC Standards

[CEC STANDARDS](standards.md)

**Learning Environments:**

This standard is met through outcome 7, the education professional will understand the difference between inclusion and mainstreaming upon completion of this course. This standard matches this outcome the best because an inclusive classroom is much different in look and feel than a mainstreamed classroom. Through this course I have realized that a mainstreamed classroom still involves the student with disabilities being pulled out when it is most convenient for the teacher or the other staff in the building. This environment is not inclusive because it does not utilize everyones strengths and weaknesses. Through utilizing strengths and realizing weaknesses a classroom teacher can best work with each individuals unique way of learnig. For example, if a student learns best on their own then let them work alone. If a student needs to talk through an idea or problem with peers, that is a possibility as well. Students learn best from their peers, these are the people that understand their true frustrations and struggles with the work provided. Universal designs for learning are best utilized in an inclusive classroom to provide any student, with or without disabilities, the supports necessary to meet their needs when learning.
